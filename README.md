# EDA_Modeling_Spark

This PySpark/H2O based module was created to automate the procedures of exploratory data analysis, numerical and categorical feature encoding and binning, as well as optimal linear/logistic regression building widely used in the credit/financial services industry.

With Apache Spark and H2O, this module is highly scalable to 'big data' and can process modeling dataset with hundreds of millions of rows and thousands of variables with ease, as long as sufficient computing power (e.g., number of CPUs) is given.
